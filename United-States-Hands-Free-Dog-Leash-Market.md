For example, outdoor retailers may carry hands-free dog leashes designed for hiking or running enthusiasts, while pet adoption centers may offer leashes as part of adoption packages. <p>Although the “Others” category comprises a smaller segment of the market, it serves an important role in reaching customers who prefer to shop outside of traditional retail settings. It also highlights the versatility of hands-free dog leashes, which are not only sold in mainstream pet stores but can also be found in outlets catering to broader consumer interests, such as fitness and outdoor adventure.
