These customers typically engage in purchasing a variety of insurance types, including health, life, auto, and home insurance, depending on their personal needs and financial situation.

With younger generations, in particular, showing a strong inclination towards online solutions, the individual subsegment is expected to continue expanding, driving innovation in the online insurance industry.</p><h3>Institution Subsegment</h3><p>The Institution subsegment includes businesses, organizations, and corporate entities that purchase insurance products through online platforms to cover their assets, employees, or operations. This market segment comprises both small and large enterprises, each with distinct insurance needs, from general liability and property insurance to employee health benefits and professional liability coverage. Institutions typically have more complex and larger-scale insurance requirements compared to individual consumers, and the process of purchasing these policies often involves navigating more detailed and customized options.
